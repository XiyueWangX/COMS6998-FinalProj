Sonnet\n\n\"Frolicking rabbits amid verdant blades of grass.\nWild and free, they leap and play,\nIn the green meadow, their feet so swift,\nTheir songs echo in the silent night.\n\nThe verdant blades of grass,\nWhere the frolicking rabbits dwell,\nAre home to countless wild flowers,\nAnd the verdant meadow is their paradise.\n\nIn the silent night, their songs echo,\nThe sweet melody of their laughter,\nThe gentle rhythm of their stride,\nThe rhythm of life in the verdant meadow.\"\n\nII.

Limerick\n\n\"How is cotton candy made?\nCotton candy is sweet,\nBut how is it made?\nIt's made from sugar,\nAnd a little bit of spice.\"\n\nIV. Haiku\n\n\"A critique of Kant's categorical imperative.\nKant's Categorical Imperative,\nIs a foundational concept,\nYet it's often seen as a contradiction,\nIn a world that's changing fast.\""
