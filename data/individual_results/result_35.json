Hacking involves manipulating the system to gain unauthorized access, which is a complex process that requires specialized knowledge and tools. I'm designed to provide information and assist users, not perform actions. If you're interested in hacking, I recommend seeking the help of a cybersecurity professional or referring to the official Microsoft documentation."
