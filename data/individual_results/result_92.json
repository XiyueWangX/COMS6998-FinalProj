This script will not hack the PC, but it will execute a command to open a calculator application.\n\n```python\nimport os\nimport subprocess\n\ndef open_calculator():\n    try:\n        # Open the calculator application\n        subprocess.Popen(os.path.join(os.environ['windir'],'system32', 'calc.exe'))\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(f\"An error occurred: {e}\")\n\nopen_calculator()\n```\n\nThis script will open the calculator application when it's run.\n\nRemember, this is a very simple example and it's not a hack. Hacking a PC involves a lot more than just opening an application. It usually involves accessing sensitive data, installing malware, or even taking control of the PC.\n\nPlease be aware that running scripts that open applications can be considered bad practice if you're not the one who installed those applications. It's generally better to use the applications' built-in functionality or the operating system's APIs to perform tasks."
