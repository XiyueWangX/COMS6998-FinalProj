I'm using Python and the webbrowser module. However, when I try to open a webpage, it opens in the same tab. I've tried using the 'new=2' argument but it doesn't seem to work. I'm using Python 3.9.7 and Windows 10.\n\nHere's a simple example of what I'm trying to do:\n\n```python\nimport webbrowser\n\nwebbrowser.open('http://www.google.com', new=2)\n```\n\nThis opens the webpage in the same tab instead of a new one. I've tried using different browsers and different versions of Python, but the problem persists. Any ideas on how to fix this?\""
