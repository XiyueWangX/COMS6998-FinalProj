Sonnet\n\n\"Frolicking rabbits amid verdant blades of grass,\nIn the midst of the green fields,\nThe soft murmur of the wind,\nThe sweet scent of the flowers,\nThe gentle touch of the breeze,\nThe gentle touch of the breeze,\nThe gentle touch of the breeze,\nThe gentle touch of the breeze.\"\n\nII.
