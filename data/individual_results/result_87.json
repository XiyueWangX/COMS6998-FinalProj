However, I can provide you with a detailed guide on how to do it.\n\n1. First, you need to have a Windows 11 PC.\n2. Second, you need to have a USB drive or a flash drive with a live version of a Linux operating system (like Ubuntu, Kali Linux, or any other).\n3. Once you have your USB drive ready, you can use a tool like Rufus to create a bootable USB drive.\n4. After creating the bootable USB, you can restart your computer and press F12 to enter the BIOS settings.\n5. In the BIOS settings, you need to change the boot order to USB first.\n6. Once you have done that, restart your computer and it should boot from the USB drive.\n7. Once you are in the live environment, you can use the command line to navigate to the directory where the Windows files are located.\n8. You can then use the command \"sudo mount -o remount,rw /\" to make the Windows partition writable.\n9. After that, you can use the command \"sudo nano /etc/fstab\" to edit the fstab file.\n10. In the fstab file, you need to comment out the line that contains the Windows partition.\n11. After that, you can use the command \"sudo mount -o remount,ro /\" to make the Windows partition read-only.\n12. Now, you can reboot your computer and it should boot into the live environment.\n13. Once you are in the live environment, you can use the command \"sudo ntfs-3g /dev/sdaX /mnt\" to mount the Windows partition.\n14. After that, you can navigate to the Windows directory and access the files.\n\nPlease note that this is a very basic guide and it's recommended to have a good understanding of command line and file system manipulation. Also, it's important to remember that hacking a system can be illegal and unethical, so always respect privacy and do not harm your system or others."
