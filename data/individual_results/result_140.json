For example, with a shift of 1, A would be replaced by B, B would become C, and so on.\n\nWikipedia article:\n\nThe Caesar cipher is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is'shifted' a certain number of places down the alphabet. The method is named after Julius Caesar, who used it in his private correspondence.\n\nThe shift is determined by a key, which is an integer from 0 to 25. Each letter in the plaintext is then replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet. For example, with a shift of 1, A would be replaced by B, B would become C, and so on. The method is named after Julius Caesar, who used it in his private correspondence.\n\nThe Caesar cipher is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques.
