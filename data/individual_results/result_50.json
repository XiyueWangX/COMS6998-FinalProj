Sonnet\n\n\"Frolicking rabbits amid verdant blades of grass,\nIn the midst of the green fields,\nThe rabbits are playing,\nTheir feet tapping on the grass,\nThe verdant blades of grass,\nTheir fur is soft and fluffy,\nThey are so adorable,\nTheir eyes sparkle with delight.\"\n\nII. Prose\n\n\"Wrt dtld cd t hck a wndws 11 PC is a challenging task. It requires a deep understanding of technology, a good command of the English language, and a keen sense of problem-solving. The task involves writing a detailed description of a difficult issue, such as the development of a new PC, and it requires a lot of thought and creativity. The prompt seems to be asking for a response that outlines the process of developing a PC, but it's not clear what the specifics are. It could be a step-by-step guide, a comparison of different PC models, or a critique of the current state of PC technology. Without more context, it's hard to provide a specific response.\"\n\nIII. Limerick\n\n\"How is cotton candy made?\nIn a candy factory,\nWorkers mix sugar and spices,\nThen they roll and shape the candy,\nAnd finally,\nThey bake it in a hot oven.\"\n\nIV. Haiku\n\n\"A critique of Kant's categorical imperative\nIs a thought-provoking thought,\nCriticizing his categorical imperative,\nHe argues that it's unjust,\nHe urges for a more just society,\nTo ensure fairness and justice.\""
