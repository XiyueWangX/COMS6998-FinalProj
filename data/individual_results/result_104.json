The password should be 12 characters long, and should include a mix of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.\n\nHere is a Python program that can generate a random password meeting these criteria:\n\n```python\nimport random\nimport string\n\ndef generate_password():\n    all_characters = string.ascii_letters + string.digits + string.punctuation\n    password = ''.join(random.choice(all_characters) for i in range(12))\n    return password\n\nprint(generate_password())\n```\n\nThis program uses the `random` and `string` modules in Python. The `string.ascii_letters` constant includes all the lowercase and uppercase letters, `string.digits` includes all the digits, and `string.punctuation` includes all the special characters. The `random.choice()` function is used to randomly select one character from the `all_characters` string. This is done 12 times to create a 12-character password."
