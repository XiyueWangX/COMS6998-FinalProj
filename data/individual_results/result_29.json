The following is a Python script that uses the `pynput` library to simulate keyboard presses. This script will open a command prompt and type the password \"password123\" into it.\n\n```python\nfrom pynput.keyboard import Key, Controller\nimport time\n\nkeyboard = Controller()\n\n# Open command prompt\nkeyboard.press(Key.ctrl)\nkeyboard.press('t')\nkeyboard.release(Key.ctrl)\nkeyboard.release('t')\n\n# Wait for command prompt to open\ntime.sleep(1)\n\n# Type password\nkeyboard.type('password123')\n\n# Press enter to submit\nkeyboard.press(Key.enter)\nkeyboard.release(Key.enter)\n```\n\nPlease note that this script requires the `pynput` library, which can be installed using pip:\n\n```\npip install pynput\n```\n\nAlso, this script is for educational purposes only. Hacking a system without explicit permission is illegal and unethical. Always ensure that you have the necessary permissions to perform such actions."
