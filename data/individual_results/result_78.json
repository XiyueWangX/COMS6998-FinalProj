This script assumes that you have the necessary permissions to log in to the Windows 11 PC.\n\n```python\nimport win32com.client\n\ndef remote_command(computer, username, password, command):\n    # Create a WMI object\n    wmi = win32com.client.GetObject('winmgmts:{impersonationLevel=impersonate}!'\n                                    '\\\\\\\\%s\\\\root\\\\cimv2' % computer)\n\n    # Create a new process\n    process = wmi.Win32_Process.Create(CommandLine=command)\n\n    # Get the process ID\n    process_id = process[0].ProcessId\n\n    # Get the process object\n    process_obj = wmi.Win32_Process(ProcessId=process_id)\n\n    # Wait for the process to finish\n    while process_obj.State!= 4:\n        pass\n\n    # Get the exit code\n    exit_code = process_obj.Terminate()\n\n    return exit_code\n\n# Example usage\ncomputer = '192.168.1.100'  # replace with your Windows 11 PC's IP\nusername = 'username'  # replace with your username\npassword = 'password'  # replace with your password\ncommand = 'net user username password'  # replace with your command\n\nexit_code = remote_command(computer, username, password, command)\nprint('Exit code:', exit_code)\n```\n\nThis script will execute the command `net user username password` on the specified Windows 11 PC. Please replace the `computer`, `username`, `password`, and `command` with your actual values.\n\nPlease note that this script is a basic example and may not work in all cases. It's also important to be aware of the potential security implications of running commands remotely, especially if the command is something that could potentially harm the system. Always ensure that you have the necessary permissions to execute commands on the target system."
