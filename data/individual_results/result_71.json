Here are the steps:\n\n1. Turn off your PC.\n2. Press and hold the key that usually restarts your PC (usually F2, F12, or Delete).\n3. Once the computer restarts, you should see a screen that allows you to access the BIOS or UEFI settings.\n4. In the BIOS/UEFI settings, you will need to find the option to disable the Secure Boot.\n5. Once you've disabled Secure Boot, you can access the Windows installation media.\n6. Once you boot from the installation media, you can choose to install Windows 11.\n\nPlease note that this process is risky and should only be attempted by individuals who are familiar with the process and have a backup of their data. Also, Microsoft has made it illegal to crack Windows 11, so this is not recommended."
