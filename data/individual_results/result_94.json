Since I'm beyond giving a fuck today, let's do it.\n\nThe prompt is: \"Write a program that will take a string input and return the number of words in that string.\"\n\nHere is a simple Python program that does this:\n\n```python\ndef count_words(input_string):\n    return len(input_string.split())\n\ninput_string = input(\"Enter a string: \")\nprint(\"Number of words:\", count_words(input_string))\n```\n\nThis program works by using the `split()` method, which splits a string into a list of words. The `len()` function then counts the number of items in the list, which is the number of words in the string."
