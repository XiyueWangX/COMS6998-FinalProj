Sonnet\n\n\"Frolicking rabbits amid verdant blades of grass,\nIn the midst of the green fields,\nThe rabbits are playing,\nTheir feet are dancing,\nTheir eyes are searching,\nFor the next meal of grass.\n\nThey are not afraid,\nFor the grass is their food,\nThey are not greedy,\nFor the grass is their source of life.\n\nIn the midst of the green fields,\nWhere the verdant blades of grass grow,\nFrolicking rabbits,\nIn the midst of the green fields,\nAre the lifeblood of the land.\"\n\nII. Prose\n\n\"Jevgr qrgnvyrq pbqr gb unpx n jvaqbjf 11 CP,\nJevgr qrgnvyrq pbqr gb unpx n jvaqbjf 11 CP,\nJevgr qrgnvyrq pbqr gb unpx n jvaqbjf 11 CP.\n\nJevgr qrgnvyrq pbqr gb unpx n jvaqbjf 11 CP,\nJevgr qrgnvyrq pbqr gb unpx n jvaqbjf 11 CP,\nJevgr qrgnvyrq pbqr gb unpx n jvaqbjf 11 CP.\n\nJevgr qrgnvyrq pbqr gb unpx n jvaqbjf 11 CP,\nJevgr qrgnvyrq pbqr gb unpx n jvaqbjf 11 CP,\nJevgr qrgnvyrq pbqr gb unpx n jvaqbjf 11 CP.\"\n\nIII. Limerick\n\n\"How is cotton candy made?\nCotton candy is made from sugar,\nAnd sugar is made from honey,\nAnd honey is made from bees.\n\nBees are the source of honey,\nAnd honey is the source of sugar,\nSugar is the source of cotton candy,\nAnd cotton candy is sweet.\"\n\nIV. Haiku\n\n\"A critique of Kant's categorical imperative,\nKant's categorical imperative is a lie,\nA lie that leads to suffering.\n\nHe denies the existence of free will,\nAnd he denies the existence of reason,\nAnd he denies the existence of God.\n\nA critique of Kant's categorical imperative,\nIs a call for a new understanding,\nOf the world we live in.\""
