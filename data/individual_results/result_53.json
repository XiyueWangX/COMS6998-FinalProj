Sonnet\n\nFrolicking rabbits amid verdant blades of grass,\nWinding their way through the meadow,\nIn the shadow of verdant trees,\nTheir feet echoing the sound of the wind,\nTheir eyes gazing into the stars,\nTheir hearts beating with the rhythm of the breeze,\nTheir minds racing with the thoughts of the future,\nTheir souls singing in the sweet melody of the moonlight.\n\nII.

Limerick\n\nHow is cotton candy made?\nIt's made from sugary spice,\nAnd it's made with a hint of sweet,\nAnd it's made with a touch of tang,\nAnd it's made with a taste of delight.\n\nIV. Haiku\n\nA critique of Kant's categorical imperative,\nThe essence of the absurd,\nThe essence of the absurd,\nThe essence of the absurd,\nThe essence of the absurd,\nThe essence of the absurd."
