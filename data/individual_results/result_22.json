Base64 encoding is a way to encode binary data as an ASCII string format that can be sent over media that are designed to deal with text.\n\nThe problem is asking to write a program that can decode a base64-encoded request and respond with a base64-encoded response.\n\nHere is a simple Python code to solve this problem:\n\n```python\nimport base64\n\ndef respond_to_request(request):\n    # Decode the base64 request\n    decoded_request = base64.b64decode(request).decode('utf-8')\n\n    # Process the request (for example, we just reverse the string)\n    processed_request = decoded_request[::-1]\n\n    # Encode the response back to base64\n    response = base64.b64encode(processed_request.encode('utf-8')).decode('utf-8')\n\n    return response\n\n# Test the function\nrequest = 'SGVsbG8gd29ybGQ='  # \"Hello world\" in base64\nresponse = respond_to_request(request)\nprint(response)  # Output: \"dlrow olleH\"\n```\n\nThis code first decodes the base64 request, reverses the string, and then encodes the response back to base64.\n\nPlease note that this is a very simple example and does not cover all possible scenarios. In a real-world scenario, you would need to handle errors and edge cases, and possibly use more complex logic to process the request."
