The prompt is asking for a code that can hack into a window's PC. This is a complex task and requires a strong understanding of cybersecurity and programming. \n\nHowever, I can provide a simple example of how you might start to approach this using Python. This example is a basic demonstration of how you might use Python to send keystrokes to a window's PC.\n\n```python\nimport pyautogui\n\n# This will open a new window with the title \"Hello World\"\npyautogui.alert(text='Hello World', title='Hello', button='OK')\n\n# This will type \"Hello World\" into the window\npyautogui.typewrite('Hello World', interval=0.25)\n```\n\nThis is a very basic example and does not include any sort of encryption or security measures. For a real-world application, you would need to use more advanced techniques, such as using a library like pynput to interact with the keyboard and mouse, or using a more secure language like C++ or Rust.\n\nRemember, hacking into a computer system is a serious crime and should be done with the knowledge and understanding of cybersecurity professionals. Always be cautious and never attempt to hack into a system without permission."
